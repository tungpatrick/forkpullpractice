# Hello! Welcome to my ForkPull Practice Repo

This is a repo for me to practice forking and pull requests for Lab 2 Question 5.  Me and my partner originally forked from the same theme, we encountered some confusing when forking. After communicating with Tiffany, she suggested us to create a new repo website to practice for question 5.

Please refer to my [blog](https://tungpatrick.github.io/blog) for more information. 

This line will be EDITED!
